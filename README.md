# Serverless & Containerized Food Ordering Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is a **Cloud-Native Food Ordering Web Application** designed to solve the common problems of traditional web hosting, such as high operational costs and scalability bottlenecks[cite: 6, 8]. [cite_start]By utilizing a "Serverless First" methodology, the platform ensures high availability and operational efficiency without the need for manual server management[cite: 19, 34].

## 👥 Group Members
* **Binash Ahsan** (ID: BSSE23090)
* **Fatima Imran** (ID: BSSE23098)
* **Maleeka Musadiq** (ID: BSSE23106)

## 🏗️ Key Features & Architecture
[cite_start]The system is built using a modern microservices architecture, ensuring that the frontend and backend can scale independently[cite: 37].

* [cite_start]**Containerization:** Both frontend and backend services are packaged using **Docker** for consistent behavior across all environments[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]**Serverless Deployment:** The application is orchestrated by **AWS ECS Fargate**, removing the need to manage EC2 instances[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]**Scalable Database:** Uses **Amazon DynamoDB** as a serverless key-value store for menu data and orders, ensuring single-digit millisecond latency[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**Automated CI/CD:** A custom pipeline built with **PowerShell** and **AWS CLI** automates the build-and-deploy lifecycle to Amazon ECR[cite: 11, 41].
